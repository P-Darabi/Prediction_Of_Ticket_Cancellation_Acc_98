## Introduction
This project aims to predict ticket cancellations using machine learning techniques. The high accuracy achieved indicates the potential for practical applications in optimizing ticket sales and minimizing losses due to cancellations.

## Objectives
- **Exploring and Preprocessing Data**: Analyzing and readying the data for training and testing phases.
- **Model Building**: Employing various machine learning algorithms to predict ticket cancellations.
- **Prediction and Analysis**: Forecasting ticket cancellations and analyzing the model's performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical ticket booking data, including features such as booking date, cancellation date, ticket price, and other relevant details.

Variable Name | Description
--------------|-------------
Booking Date  | The date the ticket was booked
Cancellation Date | The date the ticket was cancelled
Ticket Price  | The price of the ticket
Other Features| Additional relevant details
